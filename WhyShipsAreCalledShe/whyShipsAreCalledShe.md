- I asked my dad this when I was about 6, and he said "because you're supposed to treat them with respect" and that was a good enough answer for me
￼- Does your dad ask that you refer to him as a she as well? Or does he not command respect?

- @Tim Huber your phrasing answers your own question. In the traditional western systems, men must earn respect, while women receive it by virtue of existing. Calling him a she would be a disrespect, as it would be invalidating any effort he has made to having earned it. It takes effort for a man to ascend to the level of a woman, and to offer it freely as a handout is a statement that you don't believe they have what it takes to make that climb.

  Western symbolism is fun. This is similar to a hat, another symbolism falling out of style. A hat protects one's head, as does a structure. As a sign of respect, you are to remove your protection when entering the protection of another (entering their home/etc). To refuse to do so, is saying that you don't believe their protection to be sufficient, once again saying that their efforts aren't good enough for you. 

  Another amusing one, balling up your napkin and placing it on your plate says the food was trash, and you don't intend to return.

- In other words, "it's sexism, but it's sexism that I consider to be 'honorable', therefore it's okay".
There is no reason women should receive respect simply by existing while men do not. There should be a baseline of respect for everyone (until an individual proves they don't deserve it), with extra respect earned as a result of the individual's character or actions, regardless of sex.
"Men don't deserve respect until they earn it" is a perfect example of how sexism like this negatively affects men, too.
